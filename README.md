## Summary

Active Courses University is built on top of Resources from [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)'s curriculum, Suggestions from Software Engineer Pioneers and other reliable sources.

ACU is not just about MOOCs but also about imitating a real university community. ACU members are all authentic members providing free Career Services, Academic Advisory, mutual coaching, mutual mentorship, mutual tutoring, and much more. To Illustrate some tangible benefits for just the Mutual Tutoring:

1. Students typically get 1-3 answers within 5 minutes of their questions.
2. Students provide reviews and good resources after finishing a topic, in an iterative manner, leading to a curated educational resource after some time.
3. Students evade mistakes as others will guide them; For example, studying without taking notes, not studying from interactive courses.

ACU is looking to expand current services to support everything like real universities. This can only be done via each member's contribution, suggestions, and services. Community is built on a single principle, "Those Who want help, give help"; Beneficiaries from such services shall try, with all they have, to support and contribute back to the community.

Currently, almost all services in the Mind Map are limited to Trusted members on the server. But don't worry, because you can be *Trusted* by contributing to the community.

Finally, if you like the server/repository, share it or invite your acquaintances and colleagues. You will benefit directly and indirectly; your tutor, coach, mentor or study buddy might be your colleague you invited or a person that your colleague invited. Try to share it on your FB, class group (E.g., WhatsApp group). If you can ask someone popular to share this group; Do it.

## Resources

### Courses

* All courses follow IEEE CS2013 Guidelines (Check OSSU) while being free and interactive (autograder for assignments and final project/exam).
* Notes:
  * Course reviews will be provided in the GitHub Issues soon.
  * Resources that will be enhanced and rewritten in our [Website](https://www.activecourses.tech/).
* Students are free to choose whichever course they like, but some benefits are studying from the same source as others as follows:
  * This is the servers' purpose (mentoring each other as our questions will be around the same course, and it will be easier to find an answer); Otherwise, Won't be any different from Coursera's Discussion forum which doesn't help much and takes time for your question to be answered.
  * Collected efforts (for picking a specific course objectively) will cover blind spots that each one has, and it will be likely better than each one picking his course & wasting efforts on course comparison.

Mainly [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) and secondarily [Omar Shawky's CS-Roadmap](https://github.com/OmarShawky1/CS-Roadmap) and pinned messages in the Discord server (which will soon be merged and rewritten to accommodate other CS Sub-Fields such as SWE).
