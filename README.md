# ACU

An Open University primarily dedicated to preparing & working for Big Tech companies (FAANG, FAANG+, Fortune 500, Enterprises, Startups) by providing Career Services, Resources (Roadmaps & MOOCs), Networking and Academic Advisory for CS/CSE only.

**Note**: **English Server is coming soon**. If you find current onboarding hard, please issue a ticket and explain.

## Summary

Active Courses University is a community targeting to work in Big N. Similar to the [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) community, it provides educational resources. Additionally, ACU provides professional Career, Networking, and Academic Advisory services.

ACU Resources are mainly composed of three main resources (OSSU, CS Fundamentals, and Big N SE Roadmaps). Similar to real universities, services are provided mostly by peers/students, and some by professionals (>3 YoE).

The resources utilize OSSUs' curriculum, suggestions from Software Engineer Pioneers, and other reliable sources. (Check [ACU Mind Map Explanation](./ACU-Mind-Map-Explanation.md) for details)

ACU members are all authentic members providing free Career Services, Academic Advisory, mutual coaching, mutual mentorship, mutual tutoring, and much more. To Illustrate some tangible benefits for just the Mutual Tutoring:

1. Students typically get 1-3 answers within 5 minutes of their questions.
2. Students provide reviews and good resources after finishing a topic, in an iterative manner, leading to a curated educational resource after some time.
3. Students evade mistakes as others will guide them; For example, studying without taking notes and studying from interactive courses.

For a full comparison between ACU and other servers, online communities, paid boot camps and real universities, Check [ACU Comparison](./ACU-Mind-Map-Explanation.md#acu-comparison).

ACU is looking to expand current services to support everything like real universities. This can only be done via each member's contribution, suggestions, and services. Community is built on a single principle, "Those Who want help, give help"; Beneficiaries from such services shall try, with all they have, to support and contribute back to the community.

Currently, almost all services in the Mind Map are limited to Trusted members on the server. But don't worry, because you can be @Trusted by contributing to the community.

Finally, if you like the server/repository, share it or invite your acquaintances and colleagues. You will benefit directly and indirectly; your tutor, coach, mentor or study buddy might be your colleague you invited or a person that your colleague invited. Try to share it on your FB, class group (E.g., WhatsApp group). If you can ask someone popular to share this group; Do it.

## Resources

### Courses

* All courses follow IEEE CS2013 Guidelines (Check OSSU) while being free and interactive (autograder for assignments and final project/exam). The only exception is "Big N SE Roadmap".
* Notes:
  * Course reviews will be provided in the GitHub Issues soon.
  * Resources that will be enhanced and rewritten in our [Website](https://www.activecourses.tech/).
* Students are free to choose whichever course they like, but some benefits are studying from the same source as others as follows:
  * This is the servers' purpose (mentoring each other as our questions will be around the same course, and it will be easier to find an answer); Otherwise, Won't be any different from Coursera's Discussion forum which doesn't help much and takes time for your question to be answered.
  * Collected efforts (for picking a specific course objectively) will cover blind spots that each one has, and it will be likely better than each one picking his course & wasting efforts on course comparison.

Mainly [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) and secondarily [Omar Shawky's CS-Roadmap](https://github.com/OmarShawky1/CS-Roadmap) and pinned messages in the Discord server (which will soon be merged and rewritten to accommodate other CS Sub-Fields such as SWE).

#### Sub-Fields

To be done...

### Essential

* They are devised of 3 categories as follows.

1. Essential skills:
   1. How to ask questions?
      1. Dr. Mostafa's advice on how to ask (Arabic): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxLOqb54omI
      2. Watch: https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-scientists-tools/getting-help-dhpW3
      3. Read: https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask
      4. Read: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-ask-good-technical-questions/
      5. Read about XY Problem: https://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem
      6. Ask a binary question if possible. (I.e., True/false)
      7. If not, Ask the enclosed question if possible. (I.e., the question that has an expected answer; E.g., Which color? "Red", "Green", "Blue")
      8. If not, ask open questions and supply atomic information in an enumerated form. (E.g., "How to study Algorithms?" 1. I know math. 2. I know Programming Languages.)
      9. Note: Atomic information is the simplest form of information possible that can not be further broken down into even simpler data and can never hold more than a single meaning.
   2. Who to ask before you ask?
      1. Only reliable person that is in charge, or has been in charge, or reached the end of the road you want to take.
      2. Never rely on an answer/course even if it is free before performing rule 1 above.
      3. Arabic shorts & videos:
         1. Dr. Mostafa: Video [1](https://www.youtube.com/live/ZHMr5kPjFpk?feature=share) & [2](https://www.youtube.com/live/8pSt7yhkfSw?feature=share).
         2. Mr. Moshrif: Video [1](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1453088708370995).
   3. How to study and not forget what you studied? Use Obsidian (using Zettlekasten & Wikipedia styles)
   4. What is your opinion about X/Y/Z Course?
      1. Arabic:
         1. Mr. Moshrif: Video [1](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&v=553205550240384) & [2](https://fb.watch/jKaKqf2Rjq/). [Post](https://www.facebook.com/mmoshrif/posts/pfbid02gNUwraX2rJdykh2c6XXeAqKBh3ucdo7YcLx5qeHRqm87NywW769VavTTmZ197Hmdl).
         2. Dr. Mostafa: Video [1](https://www.youtube.com/live/jJoVVCfDCN4).
   5. How do you plan and solve most of your problems (in life and the field or industry) smartly with the least thinking effort and minimize failures?
      1. Check "How to ask?" above.
      2. Check related records or background about who is giving you the advice. If he is advising on "How to work at Google?" he must have worked there at least.
      3. Avoid unaccountable advice or courses from unreliable people, even if they are free. Unless a person is accountable for what he says and has an active track record, treat every word with a grain of salt.
      4. For you to ask someone, you need to build a relationship with them. You also might need to show that you also help when you can, as this will increase the chances of getting help.
      5. Firmly believing that you are not exceptional by any means. 99.99% of your problems have faced others as well, and they developed a solution for them, but you just didn't research enough.
2. Essential tools: [git-and-github channel](https://discord.gg/rvkdAwuW6Q) & [linux channel](https://discord.gg/TVCzqKnBPY).
3. Knowledge Base:
   1. @Students: [recommended forum](https://discord.gg/25dTf9Y78h).
   2. For @Trusted: [knowledge base forum](https://discord.gg/dJaRzXRhMm).

## Server Details

### General

To be done...

1. Categories and channels for resources are designed after OSSU's design.
2. Any channel or category under "Archive" category is achieved because it has not been recently used or merged into another channel but kept because it contains useful info.
