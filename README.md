## Summary
Active Courses University is built on top of Resources from [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)'s curriculum, Suggestions from Software Engineer Pioneers and other reliable sources.

ACU is not just about MOOCs but also about imitating a real university community. ACU members are all authentic members providing free Career Services, Academic Advisory, coaching, mutual mentorship, and much more. From Resume/CV review, job & interview resources to networking.

ACU is looking to expand current services to support everything like real universities. This can only be done via each member's contribution, suggestions, and services. Community is built on a single principle, "Those Who want help, give help"; Beneficiaries from such services shall try, with all they have, to support and contribute back to the community.

Currently, almost all services in the Mind Map are limited to Trusted members on the server. But don't worry, because you can be Trusted via your contribution to the community.

## Resources
Mainly [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) and secondarily [Omar Shawky's CS-Roadmap](https://github.com/OmarShawky1/CS-Roadmap) and pinned messages in discord server. Soon, these resources will be merged and rewritten to accommodate other CS sub-fields such as SWE.
