# Student Benefits

The following are some benefits of ACU:

1. If you want to self study because your university or a course -at your university- isn't that great, you can check [Self-taught Benefits](./Self-Taught-Benefits.md).
2. Compensate bad or no community/services at your university.
3. Gain connections. In addition to the same point in [Self-taught Benefits](./Self-Taught-Benefits.md):
   1. Community is an additional channel to gain connections from outside your university or area.
   2. Community can be a channel to reach people, who you wouldn't reach, at your university or area if it gets familiar enough just like the old regional community. This only happened when everyone shared & put effort to the old/regional community.
