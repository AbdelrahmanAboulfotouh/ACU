## Resources

* Students are free to choose whichever course they like, but some benefits are studying from the same source as others as follows:
  * This is the servers' purpose (mentoring each other as our questions will be around the same course, and it will be easier to find an answer); Otherwise, Won't be any different from Coursera's Discussion forum which doesn't help much and takes time for your question to be answered.
  * Collected efforts (for picking a specific course objectively) will cover blind spots that each one has, and it will be likely better than each one picking his course & wasting efforts on course comparison.

### Courses

#### Computer Science

##### Roadmaps

Briefly, ACU provides currently only two roadmaps for computer science: (Both follow [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) courses guidelines which is IEEE CS2013 Guidelines while being free and interactive (autograder for assignments and final project/exam))

1. OSSU.
2. CS Fundamentals: Essential knowledge for all subfields (career paths). Similar to Gen-Ed.
   1. Background Info:
      1. Designed & backed up by:
         1. Prof. [Mostafa Saad Ibrahim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mostafasaad/)'s Videos (Arabic): Roadmap [1](https://youtu.be/JkcmNrdhjMs) & [2](https://youtu.be/b56XFMNEzAs), [Why to follow roadmap](https://youtu.be/-oORn0GOWe4).
         2. SRE [Mohamed Moshrif](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmeshref/)'s Video (Arabic):[Roadmap](https://youtu.be/RAHNZhcoi_Q) & [Old Roadmap](https://youtu.be/jZIXKlSJcrc) & [Very old Roadmap](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?ref=search&v=2050195395035796&external_log_id=c27c284f-d228-4e39-9c4d-1447de1697be&q=mohamed%20moshrif), [Why to follow roadmap](https://youtu.be/aKv3QNiB1NU), Miscellaneous Info [1](https://www.facebook.com/mmoshrif/videos/344220917562967/?__tn__=%2CO-R) & [2](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&v=2172114902843844).
         3. [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/).
         4. Note: They say same thing. They are not alternatives.
      2. Community provides courses, materials & tutoring for the roadmap in real-time in addition to group studying.
   2. Courses:
      1. Programming Languages (PL).
      2. Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
      3. Problem-Solving (PS).
      4. Operating Systems (OS).
      5. Data Bases (DB).
      6. Networks.
      7. Discrete Mathematics.

##### Roadmaps Comparison

| Aspect/Roadmap | OSSU | CS-Fundamentals | Big N SE Roadmaps | Note |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Duration | 3-5 Years | 9-12 Months | 4-6 Months. | Low and high estimated completion time for fresh students with no CS background. |
| Resources | Restricted to provided courses in README. Most courses are the best MOOCs. Some courses are provided supervisionally and were not tested for quality. | Resources are your own choice. It is advised for courses to follow OSSU's guidelines, which have been reviewed by other students. | They are not courses, so there are no restrictions, and the learning depends on solving problems, despite where you learned from. | OSSU provides the best courses from the start (python for everybody) until (Programming Languages Course), and some courses start to degrade in quality, like Alberta's courses, so it is better to study them from NPTEL or other good quality courses. For the Stanford Algorithms course, the comparison is left for everyone between it and Princeton Algorithms: either theoretical-based or practical-based, as Stanford is language-agnostic, but Princeton is in Java. A lot of courses are similar, like OSTEP. |
| Outcome | It does not require further CS learning but requires intensive Job Preparation. | It gets you hired fast without any compromises, but if you want to advance in your career, you must continue the OSSU or real college route. | It gets you hired fast without any compromises, but if you want to advance in your career, you must continue the OSSU or real college route. | It is the fastest way to get hired in Big Tech, but it teaches the bare minimum of everything. If you want to advance in your career, you must continue the OSSU or real college route. No one in the community has taken this route so far to conclude everything. |

#### Sub-fields

* Sub-Fields or CS-Minor is the different career paths.

1. Software Engineering.
2. Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning Engineer, Deep Vision...).
3. Quantitative Engineer.
4. Embedded Software Engineer.
5. DevOps Engineer.

#### Big N SE Roadmap

1. They are reliable roadmaps and educational content provided by professionals working at those companies as a fast route to work at them.
2. Each roadmap mentions the author and his active record. Additionally, you can ask members for their opinions.
3. Unfortunately, courses do not always support the aforementioned IEEE CS2013 Guidelines.

Although only "Coding Interview University" is mentioned, ACU will add more resources soon.

### Essential

1. The essential knowledge, behavior and tools for everyone ($0\rightarrow \infty$ years of experience). Learning "How to ask?", "How to search?", "How to study?" and essential tools will boost your productivity 10-50x!
2. They are devised of 3 categories as follows:
   1. Essential skills: (How to ask?), (How to search?), (How to study?), (How to pick your road map?).
   2. Essential tools: Git & GitHub, Linux, IDEs$\dots$.
   3. Knowledge Base: Stackoverflow-like for resources.
      1. It is a way for new people to catch up with old resources & discussions.
      2. It is searchable, tag-able and amendable.
      3. They do not contain educational resources, as these are included in [README Courses](./README.md#courses).

### Career Resources

* It is the knowledge base (Stackoverflow-like) for [Career](#career).
* Limited to @Trusted. For further explanation for @Trusted, check pinned messages in Discord.
* Explanation of each channel is in "About Channel".

1. Portfolio: Pinned messages or forums for advice and resources regarding resumes, LinkedIn, and GitHub. Other members resumes were tagged by the opportunities they were applying for.
2. Interview Questions: Questions tagged by each company, role, and place.
3. Job Search & Application:
   1. Searching & Application Techniques: Curated list of places and techniques to search & apply for jobs.
   2. Vacancies:
      1. Commit Type: Intern, Full-Time, Contract.
      2. Commute Type: On-site & Relocation, Remote, Hybrid.
      3. Role Type: Software Engineer, Quantitative Engineer, and so on.
      4. Company Type (Size, Product type, ...). (E.g., FAANG, FAANG+, Fortune 100, Fortune 500, Startups)

### Career Advancement
### Networking Resources

## Members

## Services

* They are interactive 1-1 help not some hanging resources on the internet.
* People here are accountable for each & every word they provide. They do not mislead, misinform or be stubborn about with their thoughts. If one is not reliable to give an opinion, he will recite you from a reliable source and back his words with the source itself.

### Academia

Academia is equivalent to Academic Advisory in universities where a person (usually, Maters or PhD holder/student) offering help in the academic career path from educational field, CV, Thesis to Post grad. Briefly, anything in the below services:

1. Academic Advisory. (Currently limited to a single person)
2. Graduation Project Help: Project Proposal (What good/solid project that will support you when you graduate as a Software Engineer or a Machine Learning Engineer), projects to pick, project overview and guidelines, best practices and quite more.
3. Academic Writing: Thesis help, Research Publishing help, Learning $\LaTeX$, Word.
4. CV Review. (Can get help from other members other than Academic advisory)
5. Post graduation help: Choosing academic path, Finding professor, pairing with professor, finding opportunities.

### Career

Equivalent to Career Services in universities, it provides Alumnus, Seniors and Undergrads career related help such as:

1. Profile Review: Personal Review, Feedback & Tips for:
   1. Resumes.
   2. LinkedIn.
   3. GitHub profiles and READMEs.
2. Search Job: tailored help, tips and techniques in job searching based on your preferences from:
   1. Commit Type: Intern, Full-Time, Contract.
   2. Commute Type: On-site & Relocation, Remote, Hybrid.
   3. Role Type: Software Engineer, Quantitative Engineer, and so on.
   4. Company Type (Size, Product type,...). (E.g., FAANG, FAANG+, Fortune 100, Fortune 500, Startups)
3. Interview Preparation: Resources and personal help for all companies and interview types ranging from Problem-Solving Training, Mock Interviews or Real Interviews Experience Exchange and Interview Resources.
4. Discussions: Career topics of interest such as Networking, Job Application, Compensation and Offer Negotiation, Miscellaneous Career topics, Self-finance.
5. Career advancement: level up in company, learn more, and earn more.
6. Events
   1. Fairs: (Currently unavailable but we provide resources for other entities that provide it)
      1. Job Fairs.
      2. Alumnus Fairs/Gathering: Introduces new to old Alumnus to find /help (mentorship, coaching). It is one of the ultimate networking techniques in different industrial or academic disciplines and levels. New Alumnus, in IVY-League Universities, have the opportunity to meet with entrepreneurs, seniors, startup or business owners; Imagine having the opportunity to meet with Jeff Bezos in his early stages.
   2. Miscellaneous: Events organized by others.

## Networking

1. Sub-Communities:
   1. Problem-Solving.
   2. Open Source. (Currently not available)
   3. Contest/Hackathons. (Currently not available)
   4. New Grads: Prepare, apply & practice for your upcoming job with others targeting same niche companies. People on some websites even break their NDA and disclose the interview questions and much more. (This point solely is the reason for why I created ACU so consider carefully each point)
      1. You will get resume help & practice interviews from people who applied before you at company *X* that you want.
      2. You will provide help in resume & interview practice for people wanting to apply to company *Y* you applied for.
      3. Both of you will try to prepare resume and practice mock interviews for company *Z* that no one applied for it before.
      4. Build and maintain connections in different companies or even countries.
      5. Consider a group of just 10 applying to FAANG. On average, you will prepare for interview with 5 people, who got interviewed before you, leveraging your chances!
2. Mentors: Find help in Career Advancement, Self-Finance and the entire Mind Map above.
3. Mutual Mentorship & Coaching: Find & provide mentorship from & to peers ($\triangle 0-4$ YoE) in the entire Mind Map.
4. Referrals Help: Connect with people in the server that can, directly or indirectly, lead you to a referral.

## ACU Comparison

### Background

As a student or graduate, you mostly studied introductory courses with not-so-good content. Even some people study just to pass the exam, which defeats the purpose of learning.

In cases where the student missed important topics such as programming languages, DSA, OS, DB, and so on, he will pay the debt after 7-9 years when he is promoted and has responsibilities, yet he misses crucial knowledge. The debt is unlearning the false knowledge and learning the correct one when you have a ton of responsibilities that cannot wait for you, unlike in college. The person must choose between paying the debt, mostly by taking an unpaid leave until he learns, telling his employer that he is incapable, or getting fired.

This is when one concludes that he must learn from MOOCs to advance in his career.

Learning alternatives are limited to paid education (real colleges, notable Boot Camps) and MOOCs.

Studying MOOCs means inevitably facing concepts or coding problems that take days. Meanwhile, it could have taken 5 minutes if you asked the right person. A lot of students leave MOOCs when they get stuck for too many or too long! This leaves them with either the paid option -to get answers when you need them-, if they can afford it, or simply giving up on learning at all! So why not study MOOCs in communities such as ACU? Unfortunately, a lot of good communities provide such help, but they do not provide it for all MOOCs, and this is when ACU comes to hand.

### Courses Comparison

| Topic/Option | ACU | Paid options |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Price | $0 | Good options start at $1000 for bootcamps and can go up to $50k for Ivy League colleges, not including living expenses. You pay for the course you failed. |
| Educational Commitment | At your own chosen pace. Can pause anytime. | Deadlines-restricted. Can never pause. |
| Personal Commitment | No deadline can push procrastination if one is not dedicated and disciplined enough. | Deadlines, projects, midterms and finals can panic some people to not even enrol. |
| Commute | 0 Time all year | 15-30 minutes per travel not including getting ready or the exhaustion. |
| Content | Of ones' choice based on reviews. | Forced and if it is not good, you now will study the forced and the MOOC option. |
| Help | If you study known topics, you will typically receive a great answer in ~3 minutes from other student | You will receive answers from TA within hours to days, but answers from colleagues are like in ACU. |
| Degree | Courses can never be used as viable credit hours when applying to real colleges. | Yes, which might open a lot of internship options or training in country. Can be used also to proceed in the academic field. |
| Grading | Autograder which is greater than any TA or Professor. Check it out in Princeton Algorithms or Programming Languages Course | Theoretical Pen & Paper style. |
| Admission | - | You might be rejected or required to pay some fees especially for placement tests. |

| Topic/Option | ACU | Free options |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Resources | Have options. Most options have active people studying that can help you. | Mostly restricted to only one option, and it might not be active. |
| Services | It Provides Career, Academic and Networking services similar to or better than paid options because, in a lot of cases, we will also depend on them (e.g., in resume feedback, we will reference MIT, Stanford, etc.). | At most, you will get 2 or 3 help from anonymous or accountable people (thought to say that they are, in rare cases, great). The help is mostly resumes and job applications, which is a fraction of ACU Career Services. |
| Community | You can make friends with colleagues, a lot of us has met personally multiple times | No friendship beyond online one. |
| Networking | Allows knowing and connecting with people who will be seniors in a lot of different companies in 3-5 years. | Does not enforce human connection. Mostly, people interact with each other a few times, and that is it. |
