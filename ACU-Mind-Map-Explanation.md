## Computer Science

Briefly, ACU provides currently only two roadmaps for computer science: (Both follows [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) courses guidelines)

1. OSSU.
2. CS Fundamentals: Essential knowledge for all subfields (career paths). Similar to Gen-Ed.
   1. Background Info:
      1. Designed & backed up by:
         1. Prof. [Mostafa Saad Ibrahim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mostafasaad/)'s Videos (Arabic): Roadmap [1](https://youtu.be/JkcmNrdhjMs) & [2](https://youtu.be/b56XFMNEzAs), [Why to follow roadmap](https://youtu.be/-oORn0GOWe4).
         2. SRE [Mohamed Moshrif](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmeshref/)'s Video (Arabic):[Roadmap](https://youtu.be/RAHNZhcoi_Q) & [Old Roadmap](https://youtu.be/jZIXKlSJcrc) & [Very old Roadmap](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?ref=search&v=2050195395035796&external_log_id=c27c284f-d228-4e39-9c4d-1447de1697be&q=mohamed%20moshrif), [Why to follow roadmap](https://youtu.be/aKv3QNiB1NU), Miscellaneous Info [1](https://www.facebook.com/mmoshrif/videos/344220917562967/?__tn__=%2CO-R) & [2](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&v=2172114902843844).
         3. [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/).
         4. Note: They say same thing. They are not alternatives.
      2. Community provides courses, materials & tutoring for the roadmap in real-time in addition to group studying.
   2. Courses:
      1. Programming Languages (PL).
      2. Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
      3. Problem-Solving (PS).
      4. Operating Systems (OS).
      5. Data Bases (DB).
      6. Networks.
      7. Discrete Mathematics.
   3. Subfields: Different career paths; You must pick only one.
         1. Software Engineering.
         2. Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning Engineer, Deep Vision...).

## Essential

The essential knowledge, behavior and tools for everyone ($0\rightarrow \infty$ years of experience). Learning "How to ask?", "How to search?", "How to study?" and essential tools will boost your productivity 10-50x!

1. Essential skills: (How to ask?), (How to search?), (How to study?), (How to pick your road map?).
2. Essential tools: Git & GitHub, Linux, IDEs... .
3. Knowledge Base: Stackoverflow-like for resources. (Later, when a topic becomes popular, it is turned into a channel with its own traffic and resources. This channel is a way for new people to catch up with old resources & discussions).

# Services

* They are interactive 1-1 help not some hanging resources on the internet.
* People here are accountable for each & every word they provide. They do not mislead, misinform or be stubborn about with their thoughts. If one is not reliable to give an opinion, he will recite you from a reliable source and back his words with the source itself.

## Academia

Academia is equivalent to Academic Advisory in universities where a person (usually, Maters or PhD holder/student) offering help in the academic career path from educational field, CV, Thesis to Post grad. Briefly, anything in the below services:

1. Academic Advisory. (Currently limited to a single person)
2. Graduation Project Help: Project Proposal (What good/solid project that will support you when you graduate as a Software Engineer or a Machine Learning Engineer), projects to pick, project overview and guidelines, best practices and quite more.
3. Academic Writing: Thesis help, Research Publishing help, Learning $\LaTeX$, Word.
4. CV Review. (Can get help from other members other than Academic advisory)
5. Post graduation help: Choosing academic path, Finding professor, pairing with professor, finding opportunities.

## Career

Equivalent to Career Services in universities, it provides Alumnus, Seniors and Undergrads career related help such as:

1. Resume: Review, Feedback & Tips.
2. Job: Tailored help in (picking your companies option (E.g., Big N), Job Application, Networking, Interview Practice & help, Offer Negotiation).
3. Fairs: (Currently unavailable but we provide resources for other entities that provide it)
   1. Job Fairs.
   2. Alumnus Fairs/Gathering: Introduces new to old Alumnus to find /help (mentorship, coaching).
      1. It is one of the ultimate networking techniques in different industrial or academic disciplines and levels. New Alumnus, in IVY-League Universities, have the opportunity to meet with entrepreneurs, seniors, startup or business owners; Imagine having the opportunity to meet with Jeff Bezos in his early stages.
4. Interview Preparation.
   1. Mock Interview: Pair & practice mock interviews (Problem-Solving, System Design, Behavioral) with colleagues & experts.
   2. Search & find company information.
   3. Level up in the company. (Currently limited to just resources)
5. Remote & Relocation help.
6. Internship help: Finding opportunities, Find out updates if you are ghosted (no one responded back for long time).

## Networking

1. Sub-Communities:
   1. Problem-Solving.
   2. Open Source. (Currently not available)
   3. Contest/Hackathons. (Currently not available)
   4. New Grads: Prepare, apply & practice for your upcoming job with others targeting same niche companies. People on some websites even break their NDA and disclose the interview questions and much more. (This point solely is the reason for why I created ACU so consider carefully each point)
      1. You will get resume help & practice interviews from people who applied before you at company *X* that you want.
      2. You will provide help in resume & interview practice for people wanting to apply to company *Y* you applied for.
      3. Both of you will try to prepare resume and practice mock interviews for company *Z* that no one applied for it before.
      4. Build and maintain connections in different companies or even countries.
      5. Consider a group of just 10 applying to FAANG. On average, you will prepare for interview with 5 people, who got interviewed before you, leveraging your chances!
2. Mentors: Find help in Career Advancement, Self-Finance and the entire Mind Map above.
3. Mutual Mentorship & Coaching: Find & provide mentorship from & to peers ($\triangle 0-4$ YoE) in the entire Mind Map.
4. Referrals Help: Connect with people in the server that can, directly or indirectly, lead you to a referral.
